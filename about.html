    <h2>About the site</h2>
    <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. All fruit
    must be further processed from a raw material—the fruit and seed—into a stable, raw product; un-roasted, green coffee.
    To process the berries, the seed is separated from the fruit to produce green coffee. Green coffee is then roasted, a
    process which transforms the raw product (green coffee) into a consumable product (roasted coffee). Roasted coffee is
    ground into a powder and mixed with water to produce a cup of coffee.</p>
