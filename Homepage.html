<!--Different types  -->
<h2>Latte</h2>
<img src="./Images/types-of-coffee-latte-1610641682.jpg" alt="">
<p>This classic drink is typically 1/3 espresso and 2/3 steamed milk, topped with a thin layer of foam, but coffee shops
have come up with seemingly endless customizations. You can experiment with flavored syrups like vanilla and pumpkin
spice or create a nondairy version by using oat milk. Skilled baristas often swirl the foam into latte art!</p>

<h2>Cold Brew</h2>
<img src="./Images/types-of-coffee-iced-1610642172.jpg" alt="">
<p>Cold brew is one of the biggest coffee trends of the last decade, and for good reason: It's made by slowly steeping
coffee grounds over cool or room-temperature water, so it tastes smoother and less bitter than regular iced coffee,
which is brewed hot.</p>
